##there the most widely used data structure in pandas:
-data frame
-series

# data frame: is 2_D data (row and col),
             created by loading datasets from exsiting storge like SQL, CSV, Excel...
             variable_name = pandas.read_csv('the file address') or read_excel() or read_sql() as we need.. 
             
             or created from collection types we made like Dicts, Lists
             variable_name = pandas.DataFrame(the dict)
             
             we can create a new data frame by take columns from exsiting data frame
             x = df[['col names']] ###we use two bracket
             
             ---df means data frame, we can name it anything else for variable name exsiting data frame 
             
             
# series: is 1_D array of indexed data (an array of actual data and an associated array of indexes)
         created by getting a column of a data frame as series
         x = df['col name'] ###we use one bracket
         
         ---we make sure of it by type(x) 
         
         or created from array we made or NumPy array
            using pandas.series(the list or dict or array)
            
         ---we can make our index as we need like keys in dict or write index=[...] or set_index('...')
